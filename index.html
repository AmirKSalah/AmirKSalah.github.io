            Hi! My name is Amir. I'm a recent Computer Science graduate <br>
            from the Georgia Institute of Technology. With my <br>
            interests in machine learning, computer graphics, software <br>
            engineering, and game development, I've built many <br>
            projects that showcase depth in design and functionality. <br>
            Take a look, and don't hesitate to reach out!
